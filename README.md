## Getting started
### Repository Structure
- **`Module` directory**: Contains all computational models, where `mynet` implements our Multiphysics Synergistic Network (MPSN) architecture.
- **`data` directory**: Houses input datasets and preprocessed files for training/validation. Raw/processed data are organized under `dataset`.
- **`tools` directory**: Provides essential utility functions for data I/O, visualization, and performance metrics.
- **`module_test` directory**: Includes model evaluation scripts for accuracy benchmarking and convergence diagnostics.
